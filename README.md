## Miguel Oliveira - Contract #4: User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio):
You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface. These
should be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfully
navigating the user interface and configuring the gameâ€™s settings. This should
be somewhat consistent across the interface, but the tones and samples
should be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure. A variety
of settings should be made available and configurable by a designer.
