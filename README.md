## Instructions
Open the file named "Tinkering Audio Final" in Unity. Press Play and you'll be greeted with a menu. Clicking on the "PLAY" button just directs you to the Game scene, which doesn't really contain anything, and you'll have to quit the game and press Play again to go back to the menu. By clicking on "OPTIONS" you'll be directed to a sub-menu, which in turn includes 3 different sub-menus, each for a different sound that a kind of button makes. In these sub-menus you can change the Volume and Pitch of each of them using sliders. The "QUIT" button, quits the game if in a build, otherwise it just types "QUIT" in the console.

## Miguel Oliveira - Contract #4: User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio):
You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface. These
should be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfully
navigating the user interface and configuring the gameâ€™s settings. This should
be somewhat consistent across the interface, but the tones and samples
should be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure. A variety
of settings should be made available and configurable by a designer.
